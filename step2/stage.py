        NOTE: Maximum distance of homing seek travel per axis is 1.5 times its configured max travel,
        which basically guarantees that we can find home if soft limits are set. So ensure soft limits
        are enabled to home deterministically (works 99% of the time)

        Then it pulls off by $27 (pull-off distance, default 1mm). After that sequence completes,
        GRBL automatically sets MPos to (0,0,0) at the endstop location internally.

        Because of pull-off dinstance, you may see MPos at a negative location upon sending a ?

        Because MPos can sometimes contain random values (which makes sense), we want to set a
